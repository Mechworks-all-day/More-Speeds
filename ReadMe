This simply adds in more speed options, detailed below:

    * Realist: Standard speed, but with 2.5Ã— time for research and slower year progression (plus some other background adjustments).
    * Realist Plus: As above, but using values closer to the default Marathon speed.
    * Long Haul: starts at 6000 BCE, slightly faster year progression than the other two but uses values similar to Marathon for research etc.
